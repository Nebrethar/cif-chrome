How to Build
=================
#### Firefox
  * Create a zip file of the contents in "CIF Chrome Extension". (don't include the "CIF Chrome Extension" directory itself)
  * Change the extension of the zip file to .xpi
  * There is a helper script in the root directory named pack-firefox.sh to do this.

#### Chrome
  * In Chrome, go to *Tools->Extensions* and click on *Load unpacked extension...*. Open the "CIF Chrome Extension" directory.
  * To re-pack it for distribution as a crx, click *Tools->Extensions* and click on *Pack extension...* and point it to the "CIF Chrome Extension" directory.
